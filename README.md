# Processing
https://processing.org/

Processing was to me a kick-off into the programming world. 
Though I moved on quickly to other languages, here is an homage to
Processing, my first steps.

From time to time I will be uploading a few old project that where lost 
but should not be hard to reproduce, and maybe also try something new.


<h2>1. Planets</h2>
  
<img src="planetsGIF.gif" alt="drawing" width="30%"/>

A 3D rendering of planets, which are achieved through a class Planet.
Size, rotation, distance from sun and texture are received as arguments
to the class. 
  
Adding missing rings and/or moons to each planet, and maybe some stars, would
be suitable as the next implementation.
